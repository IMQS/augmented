#OpenCV

##Version
OpenCV4Android v2.4.10 is used in this project.
It was included as a module in the AndroidStudio project.
The java code is called directly or via the JNI (Java Native Interface).

##Usage


##Improvements & suggestions
Ideally the whole project should use Native OpenCV 3.1 as it uses the latest
Aruco 1.3 Contrib package.
