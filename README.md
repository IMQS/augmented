# Augmented Reality Asset Viewer
The goal of the project is to create an android application that will allow a
user to view assets using his android device. The user will be able to see
assets that might not be visible to the naked eye at that moment and the user
will also be able to see more information about any asset by simply taping it on
screen.

## Installation
1. Install Android Studio (Tested version: 1.5.1).
2. Clone the git repository:
	`git clone https://github.com/IMQS/augmented.git`
3. Launch Android Studio and select `Open an existing Android Studio Project`
(or Import Project if working on a newer version of Android Studio and it failed
to open the project).
4. Android Studio should ask you to install a few SDK's and buildTools. Allow
Android Studio to install those.

## Usage
1. Open your Android Studio with the already opened/imported git repository.
2. Connect your android device to your computer.
NB! your device must be using android API 21 or above (Lollipop).
3. Hit Shift+F10!
4. Type in your credentials on the android device.
5. Hit login.
6. You should now be able to view the asset using your android device.
